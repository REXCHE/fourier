# Fourier Transform - A visual Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook which is based on an amazing video by <b>3Blue1Brown</b>, which can be found <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY">here</a>, as well as embedded in the notebook, explaining the quite widely ungrasped topic of Fourier Transform, in a very intuitive, visually stimulating and satisfying way.
